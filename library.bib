@article{Hacene2012,
abstract = {We present a way to improve the performance of the electronic structure Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) program. We show that high-performance computers equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs) as accelerators may reduce drastically the computation time when offloading these sections to the graphic chips. The procedure consists of (i) profiling the performance of the code to isolate the time-consuming parts, (ii) rewriting these so that the algorithms become better-suited for the chosen graphic accelerator, and (iii) optimizing memory traffic between the host computer and the GPU accelerator. We chose to accelerate VASP with NVIDIA GPU using CUDA. We compare the GPU and original versions of VASP by evaluating the Davidson and RMM-DIIS algorithms on chemical systems of up to 1100 atoms. In these tests, the total time is reduced by a factor between 3 and 8 when running on n (CPU core + GPU) compared to n CPU cores only, without any accuracy loss. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Mueller2013,
abstract = {The demand for substantial increases in the spatial resolution of global weather- and climate- prediction models makes it necessary to use numerically efficient and highly scalable algorithms to solve the equations of large scale atmospheric fluid dynamics. For stability and efficiency reasons several of the operational forecasting centres, in particular the Met Office and the ECMWF in the UK, use semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian time stepping in the dynamical core of the model. The additional burden with this approach is that a three dimensional elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) for the pressure correction has to be solved at every model time step and this often constitutes a significant proportion of the time spent in the dynamical core. To run within tight operational time scales the solver has to be parallelised and there seems to be a (perceived) misconception that elliptic solvers do not scale to large processor counts and hence implicit time stepping can not be used in very high resolution global models. After reviewing several methods for solving the elliptic PDE for the pressure correction and their application in atmospheric models we demonstrate the performance and very good scalability of Krylov subspace solvers and multigrid algorithms for a representative model equation with more than {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} unknowns on 65536 cores on HECToR, the UK's national supercomputer. For this we tested and optimised solvers from two existing numerical libraries (DUNE and hypre) and implemented both a Conjugate Gradient solver and a geometric multigrid algorithm based on a tensor-product approach which exploits the strong vertical anisotropy of the discretised equation. We study both weak and strong scalability and compare the absolute solution times for all methods; in contrast to one-level methods the multigrid solver is robust with respect to parameter variations.},

@article{Stoneham2002,
abstract = {Computing comprises three distinct strands: hardware, software and the ways they are used in real or imagined worlds. Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially challenging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases? The tensions between computing and traditional science are complex, unpredictable and potentially powerful.},

The method is illustrated for a potential approximating the standard Lennard-Jones potential, representative for the problem of heavy ion collisions in nuclear physics. From the cellular automaton dynamics thermodynamic equilibrium state variables are introduced in the usual way. The numerical experiments indicate the occurrence of a phase transition. Macroscopically the transition is marked by a singularity in the equation of state; microscopically it manifests itself by the formation of clusters of particles of all sizes, obeying a mass distribution in the form of a power law of exponent 1.35.},

abstract = {The time evolution of species concentrations in biochemical reaction networks is often modeled using the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) [Gillespie, J. Phys. Chem. 81, 2340 (1977)]. The computational cost of the original SSA scaled linearly with the number of reactions in the network. Gibson and Bruck developed a logarithmic scaling version of the SSA which uses a priority queue or binary tree for more efficient reaction selection [Gibson and Bruck, J. Phys. Chem. A 104, 1876 (2000)]. More generally, this problem is one of dynamic discrete random variate generation which finds many uses in kinetic Monte Carlo and discrete event simulation. We present here a constant-time algorithm, whose cost is independent of the number of reactions, enabled by a slightly more complex underlying data structure. While applicable to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations in general, we describe the algorithm in the context of biochemical simulations and demonstrate its competitive performance on small- and medium-size networks, as well as its superior constant-time performance on very large networks, which are becoming necessary to represent the increasing complexity of biochemical data for pathways that mediate cell function.},

@article{Paier2005,
abstract = {Present local and semilocal functionals show significant errors, for instance, in the energetics of small molecules and in the description of band gaps. One possible solution to these problems is the introduction of exact exchange and hybrid functionals. A plane-wave-based algorithm was implemented in VASP (Vienna ab-initio simulation package) to allow for the calculation of the exact exchange. To systematically assess the precision of the present implementation, calculations for the 55 molecules of the G2-1 quantum chemical test set were performed applying the PBE and PBE0 functionals. Excellent agreement for both atomization energies and geometries compared with the results obtained by GAUSSIAN 03 calculations using large basis sets (augmented correlation consistent polarized valence quadruple zeta for the geometry optimization and augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quintuple zeta for the energy calculations) was found. The mean absolute error for atomization energies between VASP and the experiment is 8.6 and 3.7 kcalmol, as calculated with the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively. The mean deviations between VASP and GAUSSIAN are 0.46 and 0.49 kcalmol for the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively.},

@article{Tangney2006,
abstract = {The theory underlying the Car-Parrinello extended-Lagrangian approach to ab initio molecular dynamics (CPMD) is reviewed and reexamined using "heavy" ice as a test system. It is emphasized that the adiabatic decoupling in CPMD is not a decoupling of electronic orbitals from the ions but only a decoupling of a subset of the orbital vibrational modes from the rest of the necessarily coupled system of orbitals and ions. Recent work [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 14 (2002)] has pointed out that, due to the orbital-ion coupling that remains once adiabatic decoupling has been achieved, a large value of the fictitious mass mu can lead to systematic errors in the computed forces in CPMD. These errors are further investigated in the present work with a focus on those parts of these errors that are not corrected simply by rescaling the masses of the ions. It is suggested that any comparison of the efficiencies of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) and CPMD should be performed at a similar level of accuracy. If accuracy is judged according to the average magnitude of the systematic errors in the computed forces, the efficiency of BOMD compares more favorably to that of CPMD than previous comparisons have suggested.},

abstract = {Zigzag graphene nanoribbons with saturated edges are investigated by first principles calculations. In these structures edge carbons have either two H or two F atoms, and are of sp(3) type. Compared to the previously studied ribbons with all carbons of sp(2) type, several similarities and differences are found. Specifically, in narrower ribbons the closed shell electronic state is the most stable one. In wider ribbons a state with antiferromagnetically spin-polarized edges is the lowest in energy, similarly to the ribbons with all sp(2) type carbons. A notable feature of narrower ribbons is significant single-double carbon bond alternation across the ribbon. Calculated Raman spectra contain a distinct blue shift signature of such alternation, which perhaps can be used for the experimental identification of ribbons of this type.},

@article{Habich2011,
abstract = {GPUs offer several times the floating point performance and memory bandwidth of current standard two socket CPU servers, e.g. NVIDIA C2070 vs. Intel Xeon Westmere X5650. The lattice Boltzmann method has been established as a flow solver in recent years and was one of the first flow solvers to be successfully ported and that performs well on GPUs. We demonstrate advanced optimization strategies for a D3Q19 lattice Boltzmann based incompressible flow solver for GPGPUs and CPUs based on NVIDIA CUDA and OpenCL. Since the implemented algorithm is limited by memory bandwidth, we concentrate on improving memory access. Basic data layout issues for optimal data access are explained and discussed. Furthermore, the algorithmic steps are rearranged to improve scattered access of the GPU memory. The importance of occupancy is discussed as well as optimization strategies to improve overall concurrency. We arrive at a well-optimized GPU kernel, which is integrated into a larger framework that can handle single phase fluid flow simulations as well as particle-laden flows. Our 3D LBM GPU implementation reaches up to 650 MLUPS in single precision and 290 MLUPS in double precision on an NVIDIA Tesla C2070.},

abstract = {The two components of the force acting on a clean almost spherical bubble rising near a plane vertical wall in a quiescent liquid are determined experimentally. This is achieved by using an apparatus in which a CCD camera and a microscope follow the rising bubble. This apparatus allows us to measure accurately the bubble radius, rise speed and distance between the bubble and the wall. Thereby the drag and lift components of the hydrodynamic force are determined for Reynolds numbers Re (based on bubble diameter, rise velocity U, and kinematic viscosity v) less than 40. The results show the existence of two different regimes, according to the value of the dimensionless separation L defined as the ratio between the distance from the bubble centre to the wall and the viscous length scale v/U. When L is O(1) or more, experimental results corresponding to Reynolds numbers up to unity are found to be in good agreement with an analytical solution obtained in the Oseen approximation by adapting the calculation of Vasseur and Cox (1977) to the case of an inviscid bubble. When L is o(1), higher-order effects not taken into account in previous analytical investigations become important and measurements show that the deformation of the bubble is significant when the viscosity of the surrounding liquid is large enough. In this regime, experimental results for the drag force and shape of the bubble are found to agree well with recent theoretical predictions obtained by Magnaudet, Takagi and Legendre (2002) but the measured lift force tends to exceed the prediction as the separation decreases.},

abstract = {Gaussian split Ewald (GSE) is a versatile Ewald mesh method that is fast and accurate when used with both real-space and k-space Poisson solvers. While real-space methods are known to be asymptotically superior to k-space methods in terms of both computational cost and parallelization efficiency, k-space methods such as smooth particle-mesh Ewald (SPME) have thus far remained dominant because they have been more efficient than existing real-space methods for simulations of typical systems in the size range of current practical interest. Real-space GSE, however, is approximately a factor of 2 faster than previously described real-space Ewald methods for the level of force accuracy typically required in biomolecular simulations, and is competitive with leading k-space methods even for systems of moderate size. Alternatively, GSE may be combined with a k-space Poisson solver, providing a conveniently tunable k-space method that performs comparably to SPME. The GSE method follows naturally from a uniform framework that we introduce to concisely describe the differences between existing Ewald mesh methods.},

@article{Novoselov2005,
abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximately 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

In particular, the surface of a one-dimensional substrate becomes indistinguishable from the bulk after O(10(1)-10(2)) layers, a two-dimensional substrate after O(10(1)) layers, and a three-dimensional substrate after O(10(0)) layers. Finally, the effects of substrate dimensionality on molecule-substrate interactions are discussed.},

@article{Son2006,
abstract = {Electrical current can be completely spin polarized in a class of materials known as half-metals, as a result of the coexistence of metallic nature for electrons with one spin orientation and insulating nature for electrons with the other. Such asymmetric electronic states for the different spins have been predicted for some ferromagnetic metals--for example, the Heusler compounds--and were first observed in a manganese perovskite. In view of the potential for use of this property in realizing spin-based electronics, substantial efforts have been made to search for half-metallic materials. However, organic materials have hardly been investigated in this context even though carbon-based nanostructures hold significant promise for future electronic devices. Here we predict half-metallicity in nanometre-scale graphene ribbons by using first-principles calculations. We show that this phenomenon is realizable if in-plane homogeneous electric fields are applied across the zigzag-shaped edges of the graphene nanoribbons, and that their magnetic properties can be controlled by the external electric fields. The results are not only of scientific interest in the interplay between electric fields and electronic spin degree of freedom in solids but may also open a new path to explore spintronics at the nanometre scale, based on graphene.},

abstract = {We present the implementation of a full electronic structure calculation code on a hybrid parallel architecture with graphic processing units (GPUs). This implementation is performed on a free software code based on Daubechies wavelets. Such code shows very good performances, systematic convergence properties, and an excellent efficiency on parallel computers. Our GPU-based acceleration fully preserves all these properties. In particular, the code is able to run on many cores which may or may not have a GPU associated, and thus on parallel and massive parallel hybrid machines. With double precision calculations, we may achieve considerable speedup, between a factor of 20 for some operations and a factor of 6 for the whole density functional theory code.},

abstract = {Hybrid Fock exchange/density functional theory functionals have shown to be very successful in describing a wide range of molecular properties. For periodic systems, however, the long-range nature of the Fock exchange interaction and the resultant large computational requirements present a major drawback. This is especially true for metallic systems, which require a dense Brillouin zone sampling. Recently, a new hybrid functional [HSE03, J. Heyd, G. E. Scuseria, and M. Ernzerhof, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 8207 (2003)] that addresses this problem within the context of methods that evaluate the Fock exchange in real space was introduced. We discuss the advantages the HSE03 functional brings to methods that rely on a reciprocal space description of the Fock exchange interaction, e.g., all methods that use plane wave basis sets. Furthermore, we present a detailed comparison of the performance of the HSE03 and PBE0 functionals for a set of archetypical solid state systems by calculating lattice parameters, bulk moduli, heats of formation, and band gaps. The results indicate that the hybrid functionals indeed often improve the description of these properties, but in several cases the results are not yet on par with standard gradient corrected functionals. This concerns in particular metallic systems for which the bandwidth and exchange splitting are seriously overestimated.},

We can exhibit the dominant states of the statistical ensemble of tilings and show that they can display a strong structural inhomogeneity caused by the boundary. This inhomogeneity is responsible for a difference of entropy between the studied fixed boundary tilings and free boundary ones. This method uses a representation of tilings by membranes embedded in a higher-dimensional hypercubic lattice. It is illustrated in the case of 60 degree rhombus tilings.},

@article{Sneddon2010,
abstract = {Managing the overwhelming numbers of molecular states and interactions is a fundamental obstacle to building predictive models of biological systems. Here we introduce the Network-Free Stochastic Simulator (NFsim), a general-purpose modeling platform that overcomes the combinatorial nature of molecular interactions. Unlike standard simulators that represent molecular species as variables in equations, NFsim uses a biologically intuitive representation: objects with binding and modification sites acted on by reaction rules. During simulations, rules operate directly on molecular objects to produce exact stochastic results with performance that scales independently of the reaction network size. Reaction rates can be defined as arbitrary functions of molecular states to provide powerful coarse-graining capabilities, for example to merge Boolean and kinetic representations of biological networks. NFsim enables researchers to simulate many biological systems that were previously inaccessible to general-purpose software, as we illustrate with models of immune system signaling, microbial signaling, cytoskeletal assembly and oscillating gene expression.},

abstract = {We propose a simple scenario which explains why our Universe appears spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic. We use the Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama (ECKS) theory of gravity which naturally extends general relativity to include the spin of matter. The torsion of spacetime generates gravitational repulsion in the early Universe filled with quarks and leptons, preventing the cosmological singularity: the Universe expands from a state of minimum but finite radius. We show that the dynamics of the closed Universe immediately after this state naturally solves the flatness and horizon problems in cosmology because of an extremely small and negative torsion density parameter, {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}S \backslashapprox -10{\^{}}{\{}-69{\}}{\$}. Thus the ECKS gravity provides a compelling alternative to speculative mechanisms of standard cosmic inflation. This scenario also suggests that the contraction of our Universe preceding the bounce at the minimum radius may correspond to the dynamics of matter inside a collapsing black hole existing in another universe, which could explain the origin of the Big Bang.},

abstract = {Rapidly evolving sequencing technologies produce data on an unparalleled scale. A central challenge to the analysis of this data is sequence alignment, whereby sequence reads must be compared to a reference. A wide variety of alignment algorithms and software have been subsequently developed over the past two years. In this article, we will systematically review the current development of these algorithms and introduce their practical applications on different types of experimental data. We come to the conclusion that short-read alignment is no longer the bottleneck of data analyses. We also consider future development of alignment algorithms with respect to emerging long sequence reads and the prospect of cloud computing.},

abstract = {QUANTUM ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (norm-conserving, ultrasoft, and projector-augmented wave). The acronym ESPRESSO stands for opEn Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization. It is freely available to researchers around the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.},

abstract = {We report nonlinear solutions for a system of conservation laws describing the dynamics of the large-scale coherent structure of bubbles and spikes in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) for fluids with a finite density ratio. Three-dimensional flows are considered with general type of symmetry in the plane normal to the direction of gravity. The nonlocal properties of the interface evolution are accounted for on the basis of group theory. It is shown that isotropic coherent structures are stable. For anisotropic structures, secondary instabilities develop with the growth rate determined by the density ratio. For stable structures, the curvature and velocity of the nonlinear bubble have nontrivial dependencies on the density ratio, yet their mutual dependence on one another has an invariant form independent of the density ratio. The process of bubble merge is not considered. Based on the obtained results we argue that the large-scale coherent dynamics in RTI has a multiscale character and is governed by two length scales: the period of the coherent structure and the bubble (spike) position.},

@article{Lim2010,
abstract = {Rayleigh-Taylor mixing is a classical hydrodynamic instability that occurs when a light fluid pushes against a heavy fluid. The two main sources of nonideal behavior in Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) mixing are regularizations (physical and numerical), which produce deviations from a pure Euler equation, scale invariant formulation, and nonideal (i.e., experimental) initial conditions. The Kolmogorov theory of turbulence predicts stirring at all length scales for the Euler fluid equations without regularization. We interpret mathematical theories of existence and nonuniqueness in this context, and we provide numerical evidence for dependence of the RT mixing rate on nonideal regularizations; in other words, indeterminacy when modeled by Euler equations. Operationally, indeterminacy shows up as nonunique solutions for RT mixing, parametrized by Schmidt and Prandtl numbers, in the large Reynolds number (Euler equation) limit. Verification and validation evidence is presented for the large eddy simulation algorithm used here. Mesh convergence depends on breaking the nonuniqueness with explicit use of the laminar Schmidt and Prandtl numbers and their turbulent counterparts, defined in terms of subgrid scale models. The dependence of the mixing rate on the Schmidt and Prandtl numbers and other physical parameters will be illustrated. We demonstrate numerically the influence of initial conditions on the mixing rate. Both the dominant short wavelength initial conditions and long wavelength perturbations are observed to play a role. By examination of two classes of experiments, we observe the absence of a single universal explanation, with long and short wavelength initial conditions, and the various physical and numerical regularizations contributing in different proportions in these two different contexts.},

abstract = {A ubiquitous example of fluid mixing is the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, in which a heavy fluid initially sits atop a light fluid in a gravitational field. The subsequent development of the unstable interface between the two fluids is marked by several stages. At first, each interface mode grows exponentially with time before transitioning to a nonlinear regime characterized by more complex hydrodynamic mixing. Unfortunately, traditional continuum modeling of this process has generally been in poor agreement with experiment. Here, we indicate that the natural, random fluctuations of the flow field present in any fluid, which are neglected in continuum models, can lead to qualitatively and quantitatively better agreement with experiment. We performed billion-particle atomistic simulations and magnetic levitation experiments with unprecedented control of initial interface conditions. A comparison between our simulations and experiments reveals good agreement in terms of the growth rate of the mixing front as well as the new observation of droplet breakup at later times. These results improve our understanding of many fluid processes, including interface phenomena that occur, for example, in supernovae, the detachment of droplets from a faucet, and ink jet printing. Such instabilities are also relevant to the possible energy source of inertial confinement fusion, in which a millimeter-sized capsule is imploded to initiate nuclear fusion reactions between deuterium and tritium. Our results suggest that the applicability of continuum models would be greatly enhanced by explicitly including the effects of random fluctuations.},

abstract = {Flame instabilities play a dominant role in accelerating the burning front to a large fraction of the speed of sound in a Type Ia supernova. We present a three-dimensional numerical simulation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable carbon flame, following its evolution through the transition to turbulence. A low Mach number hydrodynamics method is used, freeing us from the harsh timestep restrictions imposed by sound waves. We fully resolve the thermal structure of the flame and its reaction zone, eliminating the need for a flame model. A single density is considered, {\$}1.5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}7 \backslashgcc{\$}, and half carbon$\backslash$slash half oxygen fuel--conditions under which the flame propagated in the flamelet regime in our related two-dimensional study. We compare to a corresponding two-dimensional simulation, and show that while fire-polishing keeps the small features suppressed in two dimensions, turbulence wrinkles the flame on far smaller scales in the three-dimensional case, suggesting that the transition to the distributed burning regime occurs at higher densities in three dimensions. Detailed turbulence diagnostics are provided. We show that the turbulence follows a Kolmogorov spectrum and is highly anisotropic on the large scales, with a much larger integral scale in the direction of gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it becomes more isotropic as it cascades down to small scales. Based on the turbulent statistics and the flame properties of our simulation, we compute the Gibson scale. We show the progress of the turbulent flame through a classic combustion regime diagram, indicating that the flame just enters the distributed burning regime near the end of our simulation.},

@article{Kilkenny1994a,
abstract = {It has been recognized for many years that the most significant limitation of inertial confinement fusion(ICF) is the Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability. It limits the distance an ablatively driven shell can be moved to several times its initial thickness. Fortunately material flow through the unstable region at velocity v A reduces the growth rate to √kg/1+kL−$\beta$kv A with $\beta$ from 2–3. In recent years experiments using both x‐ray drive and smoothed laser drive to accelerate foils have confirmed the community's understanding of the ablative RT instability in planar geometry. The growth of small initial modulations on the foils is measured for growth factors up to 60 for direct drive and 80 for indirect drive. For x‐ray drive large stabilization is evident. After some growth, the instability enters the nonlinear phase when mode coupling and saturation are also seen and compare well with modeling. Normalized growth rates for direct drive are measured to be higher, but strategies for reduction by raising the isentrope are being investigated. For direct drive, high spatial frequencies are imprinted from the laser beam and amplified by the RT instability. Modeling shows an understanding of this ‘‘laser imprinting.''},

The mathematical problem i sreduced to one in characteristic values in a fourth-order differential equation and a variational principle characterizing the solution is enunciated. The particular case of two uniform fluids of different densities (but the same kinematic viscosity) separated by a horizontal boundary is considered in some detail. The mode of maximum instability in case the upper fluid is more dense and the manner of decay in case the lower fluid is more dense are determined; and the results of the calculations are illustreatd graphically. Gravity waves (obtained in the limit when the density of the upper fulid is zero) are also treated.},

@article{Livescu2013,
abstract = {A tentative review is presented of various approaches for numerical simulations of two-fluid gaseous mixtures at high density ratios, as they have been applied to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI). Systems exhibiting such RTI behaviour extend from atomistic sizes to scales where the continuum approximation becomes valid. Each level of description can fit into a hierarchy of theoretical models and the governing equations appropriate for each model, with their assumptions, are presented. In particular, because the compressible to incompressible limit of the Navier-Stokes equations is not unique and understanding compressibility effects in the RTI critically depends on having the appropriate basis for comparison, two relevant incompressible limits are presented. One of these limits has not been considered before. Recent results from RTI simulations, spanning the levels of description presented, are reviewed in connection to the material mixing problem. Owing to the computational limitations, most in-depth RTI results have been obtained for the incompressible case. Two such results, concerning the asymmetry of the mixing and small-scale anisotropy anomaly, as well as the possibility of a mixing transition in the RTI, are surveyed. New lines for further investigation are suggested and it is hoped that bringing together such diverse levels of description may provide new ideas and increased motivation for studying such flows.},
