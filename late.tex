\section{Late-time behavior}

For low Rayleigh numbers, the bubble stagnates before reaching the top of the computational domain.

For high Rayleigh numbers, the bubble grows until it begins to interact with the finite height domain.
The affected trajectories are therefore incomplete.

Some of the coefficients, specifically $C_7$ and $C_2$, have increasing effects late in the bubble growth.
Therefore, the incomplete trajectories are relatively underconstrained in these parameters, i.e. the trajectory is relatively insensetive to their values.
