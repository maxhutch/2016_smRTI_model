\paragraph{Accuracy of model}

\paragraph{Failing cases}
Stagnation transient.


\paragraph{Interpretation of fit parameters}

\paragraph{Model extensions}
Vorticity build-up to model stagnation

Moderate Atwood numbers (breaking bubble-spike symmetry).

\paragraph{Numerical proposals}
Direct numerical simulations are capable of resolving momentum mixing, that is viscosity, throughout the range of sub-turbulent Grashof numbers treated by this model.
Scalar mixing, on the other hand, can result in far thinner boundary layers which are beyond the resolution of even the largest of simulations.
For this reason, we are left to analyze the behavior of flows in the limit as the Schmidt number becomes large, without actually being able to access physically relevant values.
