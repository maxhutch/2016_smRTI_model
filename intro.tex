\section{Introduction}

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability has been the study subject of considerable study since its characterization by Lord Rayleigh in the 19th century.
Despite this, many aspects of the non-linear growth remain poorly understood.
Analytic models based on potential flow have been reasonably effective for flows with a large density jump, i.e. Atwood numbers near unity.


For low Atwood number flows, and particularly single-mode initial conditions, buoyancy-drag models are more popular.
