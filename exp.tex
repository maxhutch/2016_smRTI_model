\section{Numerical experiments}

To evaluate the simple model of \sref{model}, we conduct a battery of direct numerical simulations in the target Reynolds and Peclet number regime.
Simulations are performed with the NekBox version of the Nek5000 code that has been previously validated against single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor experiments~\cite{Validation2016,Wilkinson2007}.
The spectral element method implemented by NekBox has purely dispersive errors and converges expoentially with the spectral order.
The the resolution parameters; the number of spectral elements, the order of the spectral elements, and the time step; were chosen to achieve an accuracy of $10^{-4}$ in the bubble aspect ratio~\cite{Convergence2016}.
